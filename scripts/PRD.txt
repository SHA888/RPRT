# Overview  
RPRT is a full-stack web application template that combines the performance and safety of Rust with the flexibility of modern web technologies. It provides developers with a production-ready foundation for building scalable, type-safe web applications with a React frontend and PostgreSQL database. The template solves the common challenge of setting up a new project with best practices in mind, saving developers significant time and reducing initial configuration overhead.

# Core Features  
## 1. Rust Backend with Axum
- **What it does**: Provides a high-performance, type-safe backend server
- **Why it's important**: Rust's safety guarantees and performance make it ideal for building reliable web services
- **How it works**: Uses Axum web framework for routing and middleware, with SQLx for type-safe database interactions

## 2. PostgreSQL Integration
- **What it does**: Offers a robust relational database solution
- **Why it's important**: Provides data persistence with ACID compliance and advanced querying capabilities
- **How it works**: Uses SQLx for compile-time checked queries and database migrations

## 3. React Frontend with TypeScript
- **What it does**: Delivers a responsive, interactive user interface
- **Why it's important**: TypeScript adds type safety to the frontend, catching errors at compile time
- **How it works**: Built with Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

## 4. Development Tooling
- **What it does**: Includes comprehensive development tools and configurations
- **Why it's important**: Ensures consistent development experience and code quality
- **How it works**: Includes ESLint, Prettier, and other tools pre-configured

# User Experience  
## User Personas
1. **Full-stack Developers**: Primary users who want to quickly start new projects
2. **Backend Developers**: Rust developers needing a modern web frontend
3. **Frontend Developers**: TypeScript/React developers who want a robust backend

## Key User Flows
1. **Project Initialization**: Clone, configure, and start development
2. **Development Workflow**: Make changes with hot-reloading and type checking
3. **Database Management**: Run and manage database migrations
4. **Testing**: Run unit and integration tests
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to various cloud providers

## UI/UX Considerations
- **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and intuitive project structure
- **Error Handling**: Helpful error messages and logging
- **Performance**: Optimized builds and efficient development server
