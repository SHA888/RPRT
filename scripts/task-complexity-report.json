      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of a monorepo for Rust backend and React frontend into subtasks, including initializing each project, configuring build tools, Docker setup, code quality tools, CI/CD workflow, and documentation files.",
      "reasoning": "Establishing a monorepo with both Rust and React involves multiple technologies, careful directory structuring, and integration of build systems, Docker, and CI/CD. Each step (backend, frontend, Docker, CI/CD, linting, documentation) is distinct and can be error-prone if not handled separately. Best practices recommend clear separation and modularization for maintainability and scalability.[1][5]"
